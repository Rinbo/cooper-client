# Cooper Test App (client side)

This is the client side code of the Cooper App. A user can sign up and use the app by entering how far he or she can run in 12 minutes (the cooper test). Depending on the distance covered, the app returns a message specifying their result as a performance metric compared to the mean of the population in their respective category (gender and age). The result can be stored on their account on a backend application running on Heroku. In addition the app will show you charts of your perfomance over time.

The client side app is created with Ionic, while the backend is created with Ruby on Rails and can be found here: https://github.com/Rinbo/cooper-api
